        <h1>ADULT INFORMATION & CONSENT SHEET</h1>
        <p>Thank you for carefully reading this information sheet, a copy of which you can keep for your records. 
          This study is being conducted by Yesesvi Konakanchi (yk357@sussex.ac.uk) and Dr John Maule (j.maule@sussex.ac.uk) 
          from the School of Psychology, University of Sussex, who are happy to be contacted if you have any questions.</p>
        <h2>INVITATION TO TAKE PART</h2>
        <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study to further our understanding of colour vision. 
          The research is being funded by the School of Psychology, University of Sussex.</p>
        <h2>WHY HAVE I BEEN INVITED FOR TESTING AND WHAT WILL I DO?</h2>
        <p>We are testing adults colour perception on their phones. The experiment will take no more than 30 minutes. 
          It involves making remote colour adjustments on your mobile device, followed by a short questionnaire.</p>
        <p>For the study, you will be required to download an app on your mobile device by following this link – 
          <a href="https://sussex-psychology-software-team.github.io/Colour-Adjust/colour-adjust.html">https://sussex-psychology-software-team.github.io/Colour-Adjust/colour-adjust.html</a>.
          Although it is preferred to complete the study on the phone, you can still follow the link on a computer device and complete the study, 
          if so, please state in the questionnaire that you are not doing the study on your phone.</p>
        <p>After completing the task, you will be invited to do a small calibration procedure which measures the display range of your mobile device. 
          The procedure would be quick and would have no effect on the device’s performance. 
          This is optional and would only be conducted with your consent.</p>
        <p>Additionally, you have the option to choose to participate without your data being recorded. 
          Participation in this study is part of your practical learning of psychology experiments but is not binding to your data being collected. 
          All data collection is optional and consensual and choosing not to submit your data will not affect your grades or progress.</p>
        <h2>WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE RESULTS AND MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p>The results of this research may be written into a scientific report for a psychology dissertation and/or publication. 
          We anticipate being able to provide a summary of our findings on request from January 2025.</p>
        <p>Your privacy will be ensured in the way described in the consent information below. 
          Please read this information carefully and then, if you wish to take part, please proceed to show you have fully understood this sheet, 
          and that you consent to take part in the study as it is described here.</p>
        <p>You will generate your own participant code by giving us four pieces of information to form a code which will be unique to you but could not identify you. 
          This code will be used to pair your data from the online task with measurements from your device. 
          The use of this code does not mean that your data is strictly anonymous but instead that the data cannot be attributed to a specific participant without the use of additional information. 
          This additional information is only available if you provide it in future (e.g. you wish to withdraw). 
          Your consent will be recorded with your personal code and responses.</p>
        <p>All data will be transmitted from the JsPsych interface of the online task through the Open Science Framework, a data management system. 
          Raw data will be stored in a private OSF repository, available only to the research team. 
          Both comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and UK data protection legislation will only be accessible to members of the project team. 
          If any data is made available to the wider scientific community your experimental data may be available with your participant code (pseudonym), but never your name. 
          This means that no data provided can be identifiable back to you.</p>
        <p>If you have concerns about the collection, storage, or use of your personal data, you can contact University of Sussex Data Protection Officer: <a href="mailto:dpo@sussex.ac.uk">dpo@sussex.ac.uk</a>.</p>
        <h2>Who has approved this study?</h2>
        <p>The research has been approved by the Science & Technology Cross-Schools Research Ethics Committee (C-REC) ethical review process. (ER/YK357/4)</p>
        <h2>Contact for Further Information </h2>
        <p>If you have any concerns relating to this project please contact Yesesvi Konakanchi (<a href="mailto:yk357@sussex.ac.uk">yk357@sussex.ac.uk</a>), Dr John Maule (<a href="mailto:j.maule@sussex.ac.uk">j.maule@sussex.ac.uk</a>) 
          and/or the Chair of the Science and Technology Cross Schools Research Ethics Committee, (<a href="mailto:crecscitec@sussex.ac.uk">crecscitec@sussex.ac.uk</a>).</p>
        <h2>Insurance</h2>
        <p>The University of Sussex has insurance in place to cover its legal liabilities in respect of this study.</p>
